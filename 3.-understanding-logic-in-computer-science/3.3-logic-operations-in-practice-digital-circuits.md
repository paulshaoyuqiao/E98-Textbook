# 3.3\* Logic Operations in Practice: Digital Circuits

One important idea we have talked about already in computer science is the concept of **Abstraction.** It allows us to write complex and large programs based on the assumed functionalities of each component without worrying too much how they are implemented. 

Unsurprisingly, the logic operations we have been working with in our programs have been so far an abstraction as well. Underneath these logic operations lies the actual computer interpreting our inputs and turning them into executable codes the machine can understand.

In this chapter, we will take a look at one of the fundamental physical building blocks of a computer: **digital circuits**. 

### What Does It Mean to be Digital? 

Digital Circuits are electronics that operate on digital signals, signals that represent data as sequences of discrete values. As you might have already seen, the digital signals computers can interpret are simply two integer values: 0 and 1. In later sections of this chapter, we will learn more about the reason for choosing these two values and the binary system they represent.

On the computer level, we have 0s and 1s for a digital signal. On the physical level, we represent these information usually with a variable electric current, voltage, intensity of an electromagnetic field, etc. The energy output by these physical quantities is then in turn converted into numerical representations interpretable to the digital circuits. Next time when you are writing conditional statements or loops, you can think as if you are writing the underlying instructions for directing these digital signals that are sent to the processor for evaluation. 

### Analog Circuits v. Digital Circuits

As we have seen, computers consist of digital circuits that operate on digital signals, a discrete array of 0s and 1s representing the input information for the processor. 

However, Digital Circuits are not the only type of circuits out there; their analog counterparts represent a very different approach to interpreting and transmitting information. 

Analog Electronics operate on **a continuously variable signal**, unlike its digital counterpart relying only two distinguishable levels \(0s and 1s in our case\) over separate time intervals. The word "analog" describes a proportional relationship between a signal and the physical quantity that represents this signal.

Graphically, analog signals represent a continuous function curve varying over a continuous span of time interval.
