# 3\*. Understanding Logic in Computer Science

As we have already seen in the previous chapter of the textbook, logical operations form the basis of computer programs by regulating how they behave and when they will be executed. 

In this chapter, we will take a different perspective on how logic work inherently and its implementation in computer science. 

1. A Mathematical Perspective on Logical Operations
2. Equivalent Logical Operations and Truth Table
3. Binary Operators in Computer Circuits 
4. The Hexadecimal and Binary Systems
5. Computer Architecture and Software Engineering
