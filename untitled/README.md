# 2. Making Your Codes Smarter

Now that you've learned **the primary data types, ways to manipulate to them, and how to express and combine them through methods**, let's dive a bit deeper into methods. Remember from section 1.9, when we mentioned the concept of **functional abstraction**, methods allow us to simplify the program and structure our logic.

By definition, function abstraction means that every time every time you declare a **function** \(in ruby, a method\), you are creating an **abstraction** by giving a name to a piece of code.

In this chapter, we will talk about some of the more **important and common techniques** we use in programming to improve the flexibility and responsiveness of our program. Specifically, we will address the **following several concepts**:

1. Logic Operations
2. Control Flow
3. Conditional Loop \(while ... loop\)
4. Anonymous Functions \(Procs v. Lambdas\)
5. Scopes
6. Introduction to Recursive Programming

In addition to these topics, we will also provide **two extra supplementary sections** for students who are interested in learning more about **logic operators and scopes:**

1. Introduction to Logics
   1. Logic Operators
   2. Truth Table
   3. Binary Operations in Computer Circuits
   4. Hexadecimal and Why It Matters
2. Scopes and Availability
   1. Local Scope
   2. Variable Accessibility
   3. Environment Diagrams
   4. How to Better Trace Your Programs
