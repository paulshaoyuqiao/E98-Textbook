# 2.9 Chapter Summary

In this chapter, we learned about some more advanced operations in Ruby \(and programming in general\) that makes your codes more responsive: logical operations, flow control, anonymous functions, scoping, recursion, iteration, and blocks. These help form the fundamental building blocks for an advanced and complex Ruby programs. 

Here are some of the **important concepts** you should have learned and understood by now:

1. **Logical Operations**
   1. Logical Operators \(`and`, `or`, `not`, `&`, `||`, `!`\)
   2. **Order of Precedence and Short-circuiting** in Logical Operations
   3. Chaining Multiple Logical Operations
2. **Flow Control**
   1. **General Syntax** for Different Conditional Statements 
   2. \*One-line `if-else` Statement 
   3. \*Ternary Operator
3. **Conditional Loop**
   1. How a `while` Loop Works and Its General Syntax
   2. **Tracing** a `while` Loop 
   3. **Trouble-shooting an Infinite** `while` **Loop**
4. **Anonymous Functions**
   1. Declaring Procs and Lambdas \(Regular and Short-hand Declarations\)
   2. **The Difference between Procs and Lambdas**
   3. **Calling** Procs and Lambdas \(With and Without Passed-in Parameters\)
5. **Scope**
   1. Local and Global Scope
   2. Variable Scoping and **Accessibility** 
6. **Introduction to Recursive Programming**
   1. The **General Structure** of a Recursive Method
   2. **Tracing** a Recursive Method
7. **Iteration**
   1. Iteration using `.times`,  `.upto`, and  `.step`
8. **Blocks**
   1. Recognizing Blocks in Larger Programs
   2. **Association of Blocks and Method Invocation**
   3. **Single-line** Blocks and **Multi-line** Blocks
   4. **Calling Blocks Inside a Method** \(With and Without Passed-in Parameters\)

The next two chapters will be **the extra section** for students who are more interested to learn in depth about logical operations and variable scoping in computer programs.
