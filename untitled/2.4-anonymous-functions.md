# 2.4 Anonymous Functions

In computer science, anonymous functions are functions \(methods\) that are **not bound to a name \(or identifier\)**. The reason why we use anonymous functions are that sometimes **a function is used only a limited a number of times and we want to save space in our program.** Besides that, anonymous functions work **exactly the same** way as normal functions.

In Ruby, anonymous functions \(methods\) are usually used in **procs and lambdas.** They both follow the principle of **code storage**: when the codes are not in use, you save the codes to a reference variable for future work.

### Creating Procs

Here is the general syntax of procs:

```ruby
Proc.new{|parameters| <method body>}
```

Note that `Procs` here represents the class `Procs` \(which we will talk about in future chapters; for now, don't worry about what a class really is, just know that **it is a container that has this build-it method that allows you to create anonymous functions**\).

The way procs is that you pass in the parameters inside `| |`, and the method body \(**in one line**\) gets executed \(just like in a normal method\) and the corresponding value is returned. We usually assign procs to a variable \(for future reference\). Here is a simple example.

```ruby
f = Proc.new{|x| puts x}
```

We've just created an anonymous function that prints out whatever we passes into it! We've also binded the procs to a variable named f.

### Calling Procs

Now that we've created a proc, how do we call them?

Similar to normal methods, where the syntax is usually like method\(parameters\), in procs, we call the anonymous function by using a **built-in class method** `.call(parameters)`

Here is a **continued example** from the previous subsection in the IRB interpreter:

```ruby
irb(main):001:0>f = Proc.new{|x| puts x}
irb(main):002:0>f.call('Hello Ruby!')
Hello Ruby!
```

Yay! We've now officially learned how to create and call anonymous functions in Ruby! Next, we are going to discuss `Lambdas` and compare it with `Procs`.

#### Creating and Calling Lambdas <a id="creating-and-calling-lambdas"></a>

There are **two** forms of syntax for creating a lambda. The first one is quite similar to a proc, except that we **don't directly call** `Procs` class in this case \(we call `lambda` instead\).

```ruby
lambda {|parameters| <method body>}
```

As usual, we bind lambdas to variables to save for future uses:

```ruby
f = lambda {|parameters| <method body>}
```

The other way to create a lambda is more different. See the syntax below:

```ruby
-> (paramters) { <method body> }
```

As shown above, we simply use a right arrow `->` to represent a lambda, and the parameters are also **outside the curly brackets**.

Again, we bind the lambda to some variable:

```ruby
f = -> (x) {puts x}
```

To call a lambda \(**in either case of creating the lambda**\), we use **exactly the same**`.call(parameters)` **method**:

```ruby
f.call(3)
```

### Procs v. Lambdas

Now, you may wonder about the difference between `Procs` and `Lambdas` since they seem to be so similar in the way they are constructed and called. Here, we will try to address **two key distinctions**between the two, and one of these distinctions will also lead us to our next section on **Scope**, **the frame in which your variables can be accessed**.

Distinction 1. Procs **don't enforce you to pass in the same number of arguments** **if** **you don't use all of them** in your codes.

Here is an example illustrating this difference:

```ruby
func = Proc.new{|x,y| x+1}
same_func = -> (x,y) {x+1}
```

As shown above, we've created a proc and a lambda that returns 1 plus the first argument. If we call the two variables in the IRB interpreter, here is what will happen:

```bash
irb(main):001:0>func(3, 0)
4
irb(main):002:0>func(3)
4
irb(main):003:0>same_func(3, 0)
4
irb(main):004:0>same_func(3)
Error (wrong number of arguments, 2 are given but only passed in 1)
```

As you can see in **lines 3 and 4**, even though we define the `proc` with two arguments, since **only one of them is used in the actual method body**, we don't need to pass in a second argument to `func`and **it still works.**

On the contrary, the `lambda` function **enforces us to pass in exactly the same number of arguments as when we defined it** \(in this case, 2\). As a result, passing in only one argument to `same_func` in **line 7** **will raise an** `error` **in line 8**.

Distinction 2: `Procs` and `Lambdas` **react to** `return` **statements differently**. `Lambdas` will return values normally, while `Procs` will try to **return from the current context**.

By returning from the current context, we mean like `Procs` will **treat the context in which it is defined as a method** and **attempts to return** from that method.

Immediately, we can see that a problem with this is that if we define a `Proc` in the **main context** \(**or global frame\) instead of inside a method**, calling the `return` statement inside its body will cause an `error`, because **there is no method for us to return from**.

Here is an illustration of this **difference**:

```ruby
try_return = Proc.new{|x| return x}
same_return = -> (x) {return x}
```

Like for the previous distinction, we've created **two methods that should behave mostly the same**\(printing the passed-in input\). However, if we try calling the methods in the IRB interpreter, the problem immediately becomes clear.

```bash
irb(main):001:0>try_return.call(5)
Local Jump Error: unexpected return
irb(main):002:0>same_return.call(5)
5
```

As we can see, `try_return` \(a `Proc`\) **tries to return from the context in which it is defined**, which causes a `Local Jump Error`, as **there is no method for it to return from.**

General Advice: Avoid using `return` statements in `Procs`.

### One Last Thing: Procs/Lambdas Without Parameters

One other feature that comes with a Proc/Lambdas is that **when you don't have any parameter defined, when calling them, you just need to use** `.call` , there is **no need to attach a pair of empty parentheses.** \(Note that `.call()` will still work though\)

Here is an example:

```bash
irb(main):001:0>no_parameters = -> {puts 10}
irb(main):002:0>no_parameters.call
10
```

Now, with the anonymous functions \(`Procs`, `Lambdas`\) in mind, you are ready to begin writing more refined and complex programs that can achieve amazing things. In the next section, we will discuss **Scope** and address several more features with `Procs`/`Lambdas` that relate with **Variable Scoping**.
