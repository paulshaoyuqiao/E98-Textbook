# 2.3 Conditional Loop

### `while` Loop and Why We Learn It

Before you learn about perhaps one of the most useful and important concepts in this class, you are asked to write a program for a seemingly easy task: given a string, print the string 10 times. While you may attempt to write `put x` 10 times, that makes your codes **highly repetitive and hard to read.**Thankfully, there is a way to avoid this: **iteration**. Iteration repeats a given block of codes an arbitrary number of times, but **without you having to write the block out over and over again.** Isn't this a powerful tool to use in your program?

In this chapter, we will mainly talk about **conditional loops**, namely, the `while` loop.

Now, before moving on, you may ask doesn't it make more sense to talk about `for` loops as they reflect iteration more directly and also allows complete control of the number of times you want your codes to run. Well, here are the **three main reasons** why we want you to understand `while` loop first:

1. `while` loops combines well with the [flow control](2.2-flow-control.md) and [logical operations](https://e98.gitbook.io/e98/~/edit/primary/2.-make-your-codes-smarter/2.1-logic-operations) we have just learned in the previous two sections. It allows us to control iteration through conditional statements.
2. In more complex programs, it is usually much harder for us to determine how many times actually a block of codes needs to be run. Instead, imposing conditions as a logical restraint **makes the flow of our program clearer and easier to understand.**
3. As you will shortly notice, while loop **comes with a risk**. Without a proper restraint and update inside the loop, it **may continue forever**, crashing the program as a result. **Writing a finite while loop** and **debugging endless while loops** help improve your understanding of how Ruby programs function.

### How `while` Loop Works

As its name suggests, `while` loop will keep repeating its codes inside **as long as the logical expression in its statement is satisfied.** Here is the general syntax of the `while` loop below:

```ruby
while <expression>
    <code block>
end
```

As shown above, as long as the expression evaluates to a `true` value, the code block will keep being repeated.

Now, like we've mentioned before, a bad `while` loop will keep executing forever because inside its body, there **lacks a proper update that will cause the logical expression to eventually evaluate to a false value.**

Here is a simple example of an infinite `while` loop:

```ruby
x = 5
while x > 0
    puts x
end
```

As you can see, `x` will always be greater than 0 \(because `x` is **never updated inside the loop**\). Therefore, the system will keep printing `x` \(which is 5\) endlessly \(unless you keyboard interrupt your program: in terminal, this is equivalent to `CTRL + C`\)

One way to fix this is to somehow **change the value** `x` **in each iteration** so that after a while, the logical expression `x > 0` **no longer evaluates to a** `true` **value.**

Here is a modified example of a **finite** `while` loop:

```ruby
x = 5
while x > 0
    puts x
    x = x - 1
end
```

As you can see, the value of `x` **keeps decreasing through each iteration until it is below** `0`. By then, the `while` loop will terminate, because the logical expression **no longer evaluates to a** `true`**value**.

### Tracking `while` Loops

Since `while` loop does not straightforwardly tell us how many times it will execute \(or will it ever stop executing\), it is our job to **keep track of the information through each iteration** of the `while` loop. This not only **helps us identify flawed updates that can result in an infinite loop**, but also **gives us a good idea of how the** `while` **loop is exactly modifying the state of our program.**

One way of keeping track of everything is to look for **incrementing/decrementing assignments.**

Look out for variable assignments like

```ruby
x = x + (some number)
y = y - (some number)
z = z * (some number) ....
```

These assignments **update the value of the same variables**, and usually they are part of the logical expressions as well.

Another way to keep track of \(or debug, so to say\) your `while` loop \(or program, in general\) is to print out the values of variables through each iteration. We call this process of displaying the values of the same variables **logging**. Here is an example of **logging**:

```ruby
def update(x):
    y = 12
    while y < 10
        y = y % x
        x = x + 2
        puts y
    end
end
```

As you can see, the printing statement `puts y` helps **keep track of the current value of** `y` **through each iteration**.

One last thing to note before we move on is that like in the previous two sections, we **ONLY** care about **what value the logical expression evaluates to**, not whether it returns a boolean \(`true`, `false`\).
