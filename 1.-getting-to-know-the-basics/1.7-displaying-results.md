# 1.7 Displaying Results

Before we move on some practice questions for this chapter, one last thing we need to learn is displaying the result of our program. So far, our codes don't really present their execution results \(unless in an active interpreter\).

One way to get around this is to **print** the statement. In ruby, you can call either `print` or `puts` to display the result of evaluating the program. The primary difference between the two is that `puts` **adds a new line** after executing, while `print` **does not**.

The syntax is illustrated in the example below:

```ruby
puts 3
# displays 3 when the code segment above is run
print 3
# also displays 3 when the segment above is run
```

The following example shows the difference between `puts` and `print`:

```ruby
3.times {print 'CS'}
```

You don't need to understand the syntax above for now. Just know that it calls the code `print 'CS'` 3 times. The result of calling the `print` segment 3 times above is shown below:

```bash
CSCSCS
```

By contrast, if we call `puts 'CS'` 3 times,

```ruby
3.times {puts 'CS'}
```

We will **get a new line** each time we execute the code segment:

```bash
CS
CS
CS
```
