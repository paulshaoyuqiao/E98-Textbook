# 1.1 Important Data Types

### First, What you need to know about data types in Ruby: {#first-what-you-need-to-know-about-data-types-in-ruby}

Unlike a programming language **Java** that uses primitive data types and classes, a core principle of Ruby is that **all data should be represented as objects**.

**Representation with objects** helps make programming in Ruby a lot easier as the rules applying to objects also consistently apply across all data types of Ruby.

However, one shortcoming of using objects to represent data is that it **causes additional overhead when compared with primitives.** In other words, it will take longer time and more memory for Ruby to process data than a language like **Java** or **C\#** that uses primitive data types
{% endhint %}

We will cover **the five most important data types** in Ruby in this chapter, along with some of their core attributes and methods. We will also learn **the basics of functional abstraction, in addition to introducing the Interactive Ruby Interpreter**. The five main data types \(in order of subsections\) we will learn are:

1. Numbers \(including integers and floats\) - [1.2 Numbers](https://paulshaoyuqiao.github.io/E98-reading/1.-getting-to-know-the-basics/1.2-numbers.html)
2. Strings - [1.3 Strings](https://paulshaoyuqiao.github.io/E98-reading/1.-getting-to-know-the-basics/1.3-strings.html)
3. Booleans - [1.4 Booleans](https://paulshaoyuqiao.github.io/E98-reading/1.-getting-to-know-the-basics/1.4-booleans.html)
4. Symbols \(also known as variables\) - [1.5 Symbols](https://paulshaoyuqiao.github.io/E98-reading/1.-getting-to-know-the-basics/1.5-symbols.html)
5. Nil - [1.6 Nil](https://paulshaoyuqiao.github.io/E98-reading/1.-getting-to-know-the-basics/1.6-nil.html)

#### The primary focus of interpreting ruby programs and defining methods will be the following: {#the-primary-focus-of-interpreting-ruby-programs-and-defining-methods-will-be-the-following}
