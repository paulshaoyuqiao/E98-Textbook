# 1.9 Defining and Interpreting Methods

### Defining and Interpreting Methods {#defining-and-interpreting-methods}

It is time to wrap everything we have learned about Ruby inside a block called **method**. The reason to this is that it saves us from repeating codes by replacing them with **a simple call to the method**. This is called **functional abstraction**, which we will learn more in the next chapter.

The general syntax for writing a method is shown below:

```ruby
def method_name(parameter1, parameter2 ...)
  code body ...
end
```

The structure can be summarized as:

1. `def` statement, followed by
2. **the method name** \(cannot start with number, non-alphabetical symbols, or contain space\)
3. **parameters** \(All in parentheses, separated by commas\)
4. the body of the codes starting **INDENTED** from **the next line**
5. `end` statement to close a method \(unindented\). `end` should align with `def` at the beginning.

Here is an example below:

```ruby
def add(x,y)
  x+y
end
```

This method above **returns the sum of x and y**. As you can see, to make a return statement, we don't need to explicitly call **return** in our code \(although we can\); we just directly use code like a **call expression**.

Here is a slightly more complicated method:

```ruby
def norm(a,b)
  puts 'This returns the norm of a 2D vector.'
  (a**2 + b**2)**(0.5)
end

norm(1,1)
# Expecting a decimal approximation of sqrt(2)
```

One important thing to note is that although our final return statement is `(a**2+b**2)**(0.5)`, we also have `puts` statement that comes before the return statement. This will **print** the sentence 'This returns the norm of a 2D vector.' before returning our final answer.

Here is the result of running this block of code:

```bash
This returns the norm of a 2D vector.
1.4142135623730951
```

**Note**: if we define this method instead in the IRB interpreter, the syntax output might slightly vary.

Besides that we have to enter the codes into the interpreter line by line, when we finish the method with `end`. The interpreter will display the line below:

```bash
=> norm
```

This means that interpreter now recognizes the name `norm` as **a reference to the defined norm-computing method**, and if we try to call `norm` like below, we will get this interactive output:

```bash
irb(main):005:0>norm(1,1)
This returns the norm of a 2D vector
=> 1.4142135623730951
```

Again, we can see the `=>` symbol indicating the output **returned** by a call to the `norm` method with the parameters `1` and `1`.

The use of `=>` becomes more apparent when we try the method:

```ruby
def justPrint(x)
  print x
end
```

If we run this method actually in the IRB interpreter, we will see the following

```bash
irb(main):006:0>justPrint(2018)
2018
=> nil
```

### Pure and Non-pure Methods {#pure-and-non-pure-methods}

Now, you may be wondering why is the output returned `nil`? This is because the `print` method itself **does not** actually return anything. As a result, the method `justPrint` returns `nil` by default \(though it is not shown\). The reason we mention this here is for you to **differentiate between print and return statements**, especially in situations when you need to identify where the method **terminates itself**.

Additionally, as the `print`, `put` statements themselves don't return anything either, they can be considered to return `nil` as well \(back when we talk about **nil equivalence in evlauation** in section 1.5\). If we print something in the IRB interpreter, this is what we will get:

```bash
irb(main):007:0>puts 2018
2018
=> nil
```

Does this look familiar to the `justPrint` method we defined? For methods that **don't return anything**but actually have statements like `puts` or `print` that **displays output or change the state of the method** in the process of execution, we call them **non-pure methods**.

By contrast, methods that return a **non-nil** output without displaying any additional output when executing are called **pure methods**.

We will talk more about this in chapter 2.

Now, one last thing to note is that there is a pretty **noticeable** difference between **simply calling the expression** and using the `return` statement.

Unlike `return`, if we use call expressions in multiple lines in the body of a method, when executed, each call expression will be evaluated \(while the results they evaluate to **WILL NOT necessarily get displayed \(unless with an explicit print or return statement\)**\) in the order it appears, and the function will return the last **call expression** if that expression is **the last line of the method body**.

Here is an example:

```ruby
def what(x,y)
  x
  y
  x + y
end
```

If we call `what(1,3)`, it will execute every call expression line by line until it reaches the last one, which is `x+y`. Hence, the method will simply return 4 \(which is 1+3\).

Now, there are two more rules to the **call expression** way and the **return statement**.

1. If both `return` and the `call expression` exist in the body of a method. `return` takes **precedence over** the `call expression`. The method terminates whenever **it reaches the first return statement**. **Everything after the first return statement is ignored.**
2. If there is no `return` statement in your method body, **then the method will return the return value of the last evaluated statement.**

**Let's practice a bit now.**

Here is an example:

```ruby
def return_or_call(x,y)
  puts x
  x + y
  return x + y
  x = x + y
  return x + y
```

Now, if I make a call to this method in the IRB interpreter below, what do you think will be displayed?

```bash
irb(main):008:0>return_or_call('Hello','World')
```

Here is a few choices \(one of them is correct\) for you to consider: A.

```text
  Hello
  'World'
  'HelloWorld'
  'HelloHelloWorld'
```

B.

```text
  'Hello'
  'HelloWorld'
  'HelloWorldWorld'
```

C.

```text
  Hello
  'HelloWorld'
  'HelloWorld'
```

D.

```text
  Hello
  'HelloWorld'
```

E.

```text
  'Hello'
  'HelloWorld'
```

Before getting to the right answer, let's analyze this piece of program line by line \(called **method tracing**, something you should try to get very good at\). Follow along with the example below:

1. As the method is called, a frame under the method is open, with the parameters `x` and `y` passed in as the strings `Hello` and `World` respectively.
2. Now, we begin with the first line of the method body. `puts x` is a non-pure method, which forcibly prints out the value of `x`, which is `Hello` \(note as we use print statement on a string, it **strips off**the quotation marks in the displayed output\). Therefore, our first line of output is simply `Hello`.
3. Next line, we have `x + y`, which is a call expression. With `x` and `y` referencing strings, this is a **concatenation** operation. The result of evaluating this expression is `'HelloWorld'`. However, since as soon as the expression is being evaluated, **the result is never being explicitly displayed or saved**. In addition, this is not the last line of the method body. Therefore, nothing gets displayed in the second line.
4. Moving on to the third line, we notice the keyword `return`. Immediately, we know that this is where the program will **terminate itself**. Seeing that we are returning the result of evaluating the call expression `x + y`, we can use our result from step 3. Therefore, the third line will return the string `'HelloWorld'` \(Note the quotation marks still remain because it is not printing the value of the string\).
5. The program **terminates itself**. Everything afterwards is **ignored**.

Combining our analysis all together, we can see that the output of calling `return_or_call('Hello','World')` is simply

```text
Hello
`HelloWorld`
```

Therefore, the correct answer is **D**.

Before we move on to the next example, it's your turn to **look through choices A, B, C, and E and summarize the mistakes they make.** This will be important as you just start beginning to interpret programs, because some of these mistakes will become fairly common and likely as we go into more complex and nested call expressions and methods.

Let's try another example:

```ruby
def does_it_return(x)
  puts x
  x = x + 1
  puts x == 5
  y = x - 1
end

x = 4
a = does_it_return(4)
puts(a, x)
```

What would Ruby display as the file containing the codes above execute from the beginning to the end?

This time, instead of giving you a choice to pick from. **You decide how many lines of output there will be and what each line will be.**

Try figuring this out before moving on to the answer.

Like for the previous question, let's trace this method again!

1. We initialize the method `does_it_return`. \(Note the word **initialize** here means that the actual body of the method is **never evaluated** unless actually being invoked with a passed in parameter\)
2. Next, we directly goes to the line where we assign `a` to the result of evaluating this method with the passed-in parameter `x` equals to 4.
3. This sends a call to the method `does_it_return`, and we have now created a frame under the function with `x = 4`.
4. In the first line of the method body, we first print out the value of `x` \(which is 4\).
5. Moving on to the next line, we increment the value of `x` by 1, and now `x` \(**under the frame of this function**\), has a value of 5.
6. In the third line, we are comparing `x` with 5, which returns `true`. Therefore, we print out `true`.
7. Going to the last line, we are assigning `y` with the value of `x-1`, which is 4. Note since this is the last line of the method, and there is no `return` statement, **the method will return whatever this last line evaluates to, which is 4 in this case**.
8. Exiting the method, now we know that `does_it_return(4)` returns the value 4. Therefore, `a` is assigned with the value 4.
9. In the last line of this program, we print out both `a` and `x` \(each with a new line\) \(Note that we are now outside the frame of the method `does_it_return`, the original `x` hasn't changed\).
10. Combining all the 9 steps above, the outputs \(4 lines in total\) displayed by this entire block of codes will be:

```text
4
true
4
4
```
