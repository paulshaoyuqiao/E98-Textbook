# 1.6 Nil

A **nil** represents _nothing_ in **Ruby**. It means something is **completely empty**, **of not any specific type**, or **have not been initialized**.

```ruby
nil
```

One such example of `nil` is shown below:

```ruby
x
# x is nil right now because x has not been initialized
# Another way to look at this is x has not been assigned with any specific data type
```

### Checking whether an expression/symbol is nil {#checking-whether-an-expressionsymbol-is-nil}

Using the **built-in method** `.nil?`, we can test whether an expression/symbol is nil. Calling `.nil?` on the expression/symbol will return a **boolean** \(`true`/`false`\)

```bash
'This is E98'.nil?
=> false
x.nil?
=> true
```
