# 1.4 Booleans

A **boolean** is a binary variable of two possible values: `true` or `false` \(**Note that they are both lower-cased**\). It is used usually in **logical operations** or **conditional statements** \(which we will address in chapter 2\).

We have already seen the previous two sections the use of booleans. **Comparing** numbers or strings will return booleans \(`true` or `false`\)

```bash
2018 > 2017
=> true
'E98'<'e98'
=> true
'University of California'.include?('california')
=> false
'Coding is fun'[3,3].eql? 'ing'
=> true
```

It is also worth noting that **these expressions below can be interpreted** as having a `true` or `false`value in logical operations \(we will discuss this more in chapter 2\):

Expressions that have a `false` value:

* `nil`
