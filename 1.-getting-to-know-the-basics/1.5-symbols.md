# 1.5 Symbols

A **symbol** is a variable that can contain some value. The values can be of any data type, from numbers to more complex data structures, or even methods.

### From section 1.3: Comparing `==` and `eql?` <a id="from-section-13-comparing--and-eql"></a>

As we briefly mentioned in section 1.3, when comparing two strings, `==` generally compares if they are **referencing** the same string, while `eql?` only checks if they **have the same content**.

So what do we exactly mean by _"the same string"_?

To explain this clearly, we need to introduce a simple and yet vital concept in programming, **Variable Assignment**, the process of assigning value to a variable \(symbol\).

### Variable Assignment <a id="variable-assignment"></a>

Variable assignment can be done simply using **the equal sign** `=`. This sign establishes the equivalent relation \(reference\) between the **variable \(left side of the equal sign\)** and the **value \(right side of the equal sign\)**.

Here is a simple example:

```ruby
x = 5
```

What the line above does is that it assigns the **integer 5** as a value to the variable **x**, so now when we use the variable **x**, it is equivalent to using the **integer 5**.

Variable assignment can help us save a lot of time because **sometimes the value we are assigning can be very complex and takes a long time to compute**. Assigning the result of that to a variable helps **simplify our programs and makes them more readable and logical**.

Here are five other **important guidelines** in variable assignment:

1.Besides a simple value, we can **assign an expression to a variable**. The program will compute the value of the expression and automatically assign it to the variable for us

```ruby
a = 'Berkeley'*3 #'BerkeleyBerkeleyBerkeley'
```

2.When a variable is assigned a value, this variable is now a **defined variable** \(meaning it has some value binded to it\), and a **defined variable** can be used directly as a value \(just like a number or a string\)

```ruby
x = 20 + 3 * 5 #x is defined with the value 35
y = x % 6 #equivalent to 35%6, which is 5
```

3.If we have assigned a variable some value, **assigning this variable to another value in later part of the program** will **override the original value** binded to the variable \(called **Variable Reassignement**\).

```ruby
x = 'Hello World!'#x is defined as 'Hello World!'
x = 2018 #x is now reassigned to the value 2018 instead of 'Hello World!'.
```

4.We can modify the variable themselves **by using the previous values they were binded to**.

```ruby
x = 1 #x is defined as the integer 1
x = x + 1 #x is reassigned with the most current value of x (1) plus 1
x
=> 2
```

5.When creating variable names, make sure that the name **carries some meaning that makes sense to the rest of the program**; this will help you program more efficiently and effectively as you can understand what each variable references simply by looking at their names.

For example, if I am writing a program for the menu of a fast-food restaurant, and one of the variables I need to define is the food the customers will order, I should probably name the variable `ordered_food`, `customer_order`, etc. \(something that **conveys that information**\).

### Back to section 1.3: Comparing `==` and `eql?` <a id="back-to-section-13-comparing--and-eql"></a>

Now that we have explained the concept of variable assignment, we can compare `==` and `eql?` by looking at an example:

1. Let's assign x the string `hello`

   ```ruby
   x = 'hello'
   ```

2. Let's assign y the string `hello`

   ```ruby
   y = 'hello'
   ```

   Now, as we can see, `x` and `y` have exactly the same content, however, they are **two completely different variables**. In this case, they are **referencing two different strings** \(even though the strings have the same content\).

   As a result, `==` **will not return** `true` for these two variables because they are not the same, while `eql?` will because they contain the same content.

   ```ruby
   x == y
   => false
   x.eql?(y)
   => true
   ```

   Another way to think about this is that each time we create a new variable, we are creating an imaginary box. Binding the value to that variable is like putting things in the box. With two **different variables**, we have two **different boxes**, so they are inherently not the same, and we have to put **the same value** in each box.

   **By contrast**, in the case below, as we are reassigning a variable with a defined variable, this **chains their references together and point to one value** \(think about this as **putting two different labels on the same box**\). Now, they are the same.

   ```ruby
   x = 'hello'
   y = x
   x == y
   => true #now that x and y are referencing the same string
   x.eql?(y)
   => true
   ```

### Parallel Assignment <a id="parallel-assignment"></a>

In ruby, variable assignment can be performed **in parallel**. This means that we can assign multiple values to multiple variables **within one line**. The general syntax is shown in the example below \(with each variable separated by `,` and each corresponding value \(in the same order\) seperated by `,`\)

```ruby
x, y, z = 1, 2, 3
#x is assigned with 1, y is assigned with 2, and z is assigned with 3
```

One important thing to note though is that we are **not assigning the values on the right side all at the same time** to the variables on the left side. The values on the right-hand side are evaluated **in the order in which they appear before any assignment is made to variables or attributes on the left**.

A classic example below shows how this order to evaluation affects the final values assigned to each variable during parallel assignment:

```ruby
i = 0
x, y, z = i, (i = i + 1), (i = i + 1)
```

In the **order of evaluation**, i is first **0**, and then it is incremented by 1 \(i is now **1**\), and then it is finally incremented again \(i is now **2**\). As a result, 0 is assigned to x, 1 is assigned to y, and 2 is assigned to z.

```ruby
x
=> 0
y
=> 1
z
=> 2
```

### \(Optional\) Before moving on... <a id="optional-before-moving-on"></a>

**Unlike Java, when assigning values to symbols in Ruby, we don't need to declare the data types of the symbols**. Here is a comparison of value assignment between **Ruby** and **Java**:

```ruby
#This is in Ruby
x = 3
y = "UBC"
z = true
```

```java
//This is in Java
int x = 3;
String y = "UBC";
Boolean z = True;
```
