# 1.3 Strings

A string is **a list of characters arranged in a specific order**. It can be either surrounded by **single quotes** `' '` or **double quotes** `" "`. Shown below are some examples of strings:

```ruby
"berkeley"
'UCB'
"This is a test statement"
```

To include **single quotes** inside a string, you can:

1. use **double quotes** outside and **single quotes** inside:

```ruby
"This is a 'Computer Science' class"
```

    2.  use **double/sing quotes** outside and **single quotes with escaping slashes** inside:

```ruby
"This is a \'Computer Science\' class"
'This is a \'Computer Science\' class'
```

#### The following content on string operations are quite important in processing strings in Ruby. Make sure you carefully read through the explanations and examples to understand what is going on. <a id="the-following-content-on-string-operations-are-quite-important-in-processing-strings-in-ruby-make-sure-you-carefully-read-through-the-explanations-and-examples-to-understand-what-is-going-on"></a>

### Basic String Operations

1. **Concatenation**:

   You can join multiple **strings** together in Ruby through **concatenation**. This can be done using the `+` operator \(consider this as **adding** strings together\)

   ```bash
   'I '+'love '+' E98 '+'!'
   => 'I love E98 !'
   #Concatenation also works with different quotes
   'I '+"love "+' E98 '+"!"
   => 'I love E98 !'
   ```

2. **Replication**: You can replicate a **string** in Ruby by multiplying a **string** by a **non-negative integer**. **It is important to have the string come before in the integer**. You can interpret this particular order as **repeating this string that many times**. If we reverse the order, it doesn't make sense to **repeat this number "string" many times**.

   ```bash
   'E98' * 3
   => 'E98E98E98'
   "CS61A " * 4
   => 'CS61A CS61A CS61A CS61A '
   ```

3. **Extraction** \(We will touch upon this part again in later chapters\): You can extract part of the string \(as **a new copy**\) using **slicing**, a way of extraction through **integer indexing**. The Basic Rules/Methods are as follows:

   **The Slicing Operation** is represented with square brackets `[ ]`, the inside of which contain **one or more integer indices** based on the type of slicing. 1. The indices \(positions\) of a character in the string begins from **0** to \(the length of the string \(the number of characters it has\) **-1**\). For example, the first character in a string will have an index of **0**, and the last character in a 5-character string will have an index of **4**.

   ```bash
   'Hello World!'[0] #This will return the first character in the string
   => 'H'
   'Hello World!'[11] #This string has a total of 12 characters (counting the space); will return the last character in the string
   => '!'
   'Hello World!'[4] #This will return the (4-1=3) third character in the strings
   => 'l'
   ```

   * You can **slice** a string with a **start index** and the **length of the substring** you want to extract:

     ```bash
     'Hello World!'[0,1]
     #This means I want to slice the string starting at the first character for a length of 1
     => 'H'
     'Hello World!'[2,5]
     #This means I want to slice the string starting at the third character for a length of 5
     => 'llo W'
     ```

     Now, you may wonder there are cases where the index/length is too big or too small for the string. Here, I will explain one instance where the length of the substring exceeds the length of the substring remained. The rest of the cases will be explained as we introduce the nil data type and dive deeper into strings in the future.

     ```bash
     'Hello World!'[6,2018]
     ```

     On the outside, it seems like I want to slice the string starting at the seventh character for a length of 2018. In reality, **Ruby limits the length that follows the starting character to what actually remains of the origin string**.This will be simply equivalent to everything starting from the seventh character. **Note that it won't error in this case.**

     The output will be:

     ```bash
     => 'World!'
     ```

   * You can also **slice** a string with a **start index** and the **end index:**

     Note that the character indicated by the **end index** won't be included. Consider the substring to be indicated by the interval .

     ```bash
     'Hello World!'[0..4]
     #This means I want to slice the string from the 1st character to the 4th character.
     => 'Hell'
     ```

     Note in the example above, the **5th character 'o'** \(corresponding to **index 4**\) is **excluded**.

     Another important thing to know is that as long as: 1. **The length** of the substring is not negative 2. **The start index** of the substring is within the range of the indices for the original string You will get a substring given by the interval. When the interval is too big, Ruby will simply return **the first character indicated by the start index and everything after it**.

     ```bash
     'Hello World!'[6..2018]
     => 'World
     ```

### Basic String Methods

1. **Length of a String**

   You can find the length of string by calling `.length` or `.size` on the string. An empty string has a length of 0.

   ```bash
   'Berkeley'.length
   => 8
   ''.size
   => 0
   ```

2. **Searching in a String**
   * You can find the first occurrence of a character or substring within a string by calling `.index(char/substring)` on the original string. This method will return **the index of the first occurrence of the given pattern of string**. If no such string is found, `nil` will be returned. Note this is **case-sensitive**. \(Don't worry about what `nil` means for now; we will talk about it very soon in later sections of this chapter\).

     ```bash
     'Engineering 98'.index('E')
     => 0
     'Engineering 98'.index(' ')
     #This searches for the first occurrence of a space in the string
     => 11
     'Engineering 98'.index('ring')
     #This searches for the first occurrence of a substring in the string
     => 7 #This represents the index of the first character in the substring in the original string  
     'Engineering 98'.index('89')
     => nil #No such substring is found in the string
     ```

   * You can determine if **a string contains a given substring or character** by calling `.include?`on the original string. The method will return `true` if the given substring or character is in the string, and `false` otherwise. Note this is **case-sensitive**.

     ```bash
     'Engineering 98'.include? '98'
     => true
     'Engineering 98'.include? 'Engine'
     => true
     'Engineering 98'.include? 'engineering'
     => false
     ```

     One thing important above for `.include?` is that you **don't need a parenthesis around its argument** \(aka. the substring/character you want to search for\).
3. **Comparing Two Strings**

   * You can compare two strings using the mathematical operators `>, <, >=, <=`. The comparison generally **follows the rules** below:
     1. The comparison is done **by alphabetical order**, with `a` the smallest and `z` the largest.
     2. **Lower case** is greater than **upper case**.
     3. If the strings are of different lengths, and **the strings are equal when compared up to the shortest length**, then **the longer string is considered greater than the shorter one**.

   ```bash
   'abcde'>'b'
   => false #b comes after a
   'abcde'>'ZZZ'
   => true #lower case > upper case
   'abcde'>'abcdef'
   => false # These two strings are the same up to 'e', and 'abcdef' is longer than 'abcde'
   ```

   * You can compare if two strings are of **the same length and same content** using the `.eql?()`method. You may know that the operator `==` will also work. However, **these two comparators are completely different** \(`==` compares if the two strings are **referencing** the same string\). We will explain this more in the section on symbols.

     ```bash
     'abcde'.eql?('abcde')
     => true
     'abcde'.eql?('abCde')
     => false
     ```
