# 1. Getting to Know the Basics

#### Before you start reading the next page... <a id="before-you-start-reading-the-next-page"></a>

Make sure you have installed **Ruby** \(a version higher than 1.9.0\) and a **Text Editor** on your laptop/PC.

**Part I. To install Ruby, please follow the instructions below based on your operating system:**

1. For **Windows** Users:
   1. Go to the official Ruby website
   2. Download the **Ruby Installer** using the link

      [https://rubyinstaller.org/](https://rubyinstaller.org/)

   3. Follow the directions in the installer to add Ruby to your system.
2. For **OS X \(Mac\)** Users:
   1. On macOS \(High\) Sierra and OS X El Capitan, Ruby 2.0 \(or higher\) is included.
   2. Enter the following command in your terminal to check if Ruby is installed in your system:

      ```text
      $ ruby -v
      ```

      If the Ruby is already installed, you should be able to see one line displaying a certain version of Ruby \(**and you are good to go!**\)

   3. If it turns out **Ruby is not installed** or **the version you have is lower than 1.9.0**, type in the following commands in your terminal \(adapted from [https://brew.sh/](https://brew.sh/)\):
      1. Install **Homebrew** \(a very useful package manager for OS X\)

         ```text
         $ /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
         ```

      2. Install the latest version of Ruby using Homebrew

         ```text
         $ brew install ruby
         ```
   4. Once the installation is completed, **repeat step 2** to check if Ruby is now present in your system.
3. For **Ubuntu \(Linux\)** Users:
   1. Enter the following command in your terminal to install Ruby in your system with the **apt package manager**

      ```text
      $ sudo apt-get install ruby-full
      ```

   2. This should install Ruby 2.3.1 in your system

**Part II. To install a Text Editor, I recommend installing either Atom or Sublime Text on your system. They are both great text editors with strong backend support.**

**The following instructions apply to all operating systems:**

1. If you want to install **Atom**:

   Go to the official Atom website and download the installation package \(_.zip_ file\)

   [https://atom.io/](https://atom.io/)

2. If you want to install **Sublime Text**:

   Go to the official Sublime Text website and download the installation package based on your operating system

   [https://www.sublimetext.com/3](https://www.sublimetext.com/3)
