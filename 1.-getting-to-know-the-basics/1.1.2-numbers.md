# 1.2 Numbers

The two main type of numbers in Ruby are **integers** and **floats**.

As indicated by its name, an **integer** represents a whole number \(no decimal\)

```ruby
1, -2, 3, 5, 8, -13, 21, 2018
```

A **float** represents a decimal number \(contains a decimal\)

```ruby
1.0, 3.1415926, -3.25, 9.876
```

Before we dive into the different arithmetic operations we can have with numbers, it is important to note the following:

**The order \(precedence\)** of these arithmetic operations **\*\*follow** exactly the same rules as normal arithmetics would.\*\*

Some common **arithmetic operations** that we can use with numbers in Ruby are: 

a\). Addition `+`

```bash
3.5 + 4
=> 7.5
2000 + 10 + 8
=> 2018
```

b\). Subtraction `-`

```bash
11 - 9 - 2
=> 0
4.13 - 3.14
=> 0.99
```

c\). Multiplication `*`

```bash
3 * 4
=> 12
1.1 * 1.1
=> 1.21
```

d\). Division `/`

**The important thing to know** is that `/` stands for **integer division** by default, so when you are dividing two integers, it **only returns the integer part** \(consider this as floor division\).

```bash
30 / 20
=> 1 #not 1.5!
```

If you want to return the full decimal, you need to make at least one of the numbers **float** \(by simply adding `.0`\).

```bash
30.0 / 20
=> 1.5
```

e\). Exponentiation `**`

This raises a number to a certain power.

`x**y` means `x` raised to the power of `y`, equivalent to $$x^y$$.

```bash
2**2
=> 4
1.2**2
=> 1.44
```

f\). Modulo `%`

This returns the remainder of a number divided by another number

`x%y` means the remainder of `x` divided upon `y` , equivalent to $$x \: \text{mod} \: y$$.

```bash
3 % 5
=> 3
2018 % 2018
=> 0
```

Ruby also has a **built-in** `Math` module that allows you to do other mathematical operations.

To use an operation from `Math`, simply call `Math.operation()` on the number/expressions.

Here are some of the most common operations with `Math`:

| Operations | Call Examples | **Outputs of the Call Examples** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `Math.sqrt()` | `Math.sqrt(9)` | $$\sqrt{9} = 3$$ |
| `Math.exp()` | `Math.exp(1)` | $$e^1 = 2.71828...$$ |
| `Math.log()` | `Math.log(1)` | $$\text{ln}(1) = 0$$ |

**Comparing two numbers** works quite as what you would expect: 

1.  `>`: greater than 
2. `<`: smallest than 
3. `>=`: greater than or equal to 
4. `<=`: less than or equal to 
5. `==`: equal to

```bash
4 > 5
=> false
6 <= 8.0
=> true
50 == 50
=> true
2018 == 2018.00
=> true
```
